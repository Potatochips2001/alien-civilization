Stars: There are 100 billion stars <br/>
About 59% of stars will have potentally habitable planets <br/>
Assuming the planets will be around so long there has to be at least some life forms that develop <br/>
Taking reptiles, birds, fish, etc we can calculate the fraction of which ones are intelligent and get a value (about 44%) <br/>
About 1% of these are primates.
The average species lives for about 1 million years
