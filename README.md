# alien-civilization
This is a formula I made to calculate the active alien civilizations that are capable of communication.
# Value explanations
### Stars in galaxy
Stellur density correlates to about 494,925,397,747 stars in the milky way.
### Fraction of stars with habitable planets
59% of stars have a planet between 0.85 and 4 times earth and habitable
### Fraction of planets that develop life
~~Assuming a planet remains habitable for so long, there is a long time for simple life forms to develop.~~ <br/>
Odds of planet developing life 9:1 <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200518162639.htm" target="_blank"><sup>[s]</sup></a>
### Fraction of planets with life that develop intelligence
Of species including but not limited to (amphibians, reptiles, birds, etc), About 47% of these are considered intelligent. <br/>
New study I read states odds ratio is 3:2
### Fraction of planets that develop communication
Humans are 0.01% of animals; great apes are 0.05% of species, this would correlate to 1-8 aliens in the milky way
### Average lifespan of habitable planets
Earth's total habitable time is 7.79 billion years, we can assume this is the average. <br/>
(further reading I've found planets can be in habitable zones for 10 billion years) <br/>
### Time a civilization can communicate
Assuming humans will go extinct by 2149 from high carbon dioxide and increased temperatures, that would be 175 years from the arecibo message. <br/>
We can just assume that intelligence was at 1970, this will be about 180 years before extinction. <br/>
Assuming these alien civilizations aren't overpopulated and more intelligent, we can put this value at about 1,080;
# Detecting & contacting aliens. Why we might never contact aliens
Radio waves will continue forever, after a certain point they will be impossible to decode due to the inverse square law.
### Radio waves / Decibels per milliwatt
A way of calculating radio waves strength is with dBm, where 0 db corresponds to 1 milliwatt. <br/>
So 10 dBm would be 10 milliwatt and 20 dBm would be 100 milliwatt <br/>
You can convert milliwatts to dBm with 10 * log10(P) <br/>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBm">Here is an interesting wikipedia page to understand dBm more and additional information</a>
### Calculating how long radio waves can be decoded
Using the following formula, we can calculate how many dBm a radio wave is at a current distance <br/>
![](radio-waves-decay.png) <br/>
Radio waves will become impossible to decode once the dBm reaches -192.5 dBm (thermal noise floor in space) <br/>
If we set P to 100,000,000 milliwatts (FM radio stations), these signals will be unreadable within 0.0045 lightyears (around 40 hours).
# Artificial lights from proxima b
James webb telescope has said to possibly detect artificial lights when it launches.
### Detecting how far we can detect artificial lights
The minimum watts detectable to the human eye is 3.58e-18 <br/>
If artificial lights can produce ~100 billion watts of light, the inverse square law returns 6.2e-23, which is below human eye detection
### Telescopes
The hubble telescope focal length is 57.6 meters, the cornea of human eye is 11 mm in diameter <br/>
we can calculate the magnification power with this (57.6 / 0.011) = 5,236, 6.2e-23 * 5,236 would still not pass the human eye detection <br/>
The james webb has a focal length of 131.4 meters, 11,945 power (6.2e-23 * 11,945) = 7.4e-19, this would still not pass minimum eye detection. <br/>
It would take at least 483,055,713,400 watts to detect artificial lights. <br/>
### Civilization
Any alien civilization from proxima b would have to be more advanced than us to detect them. <br/>
Using kardashev scale, this would be a type 0.568 civilization (we are a 0.5 type civilization). <br/>
The chances of detecting artificial lights from proxima b if there is life is 20.7% <br/>
If the chances of life on proxima b is 58%, 0.58 * 0.27 is 16% chance.
