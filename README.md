# alien-civilization
This is a formula I made to calculate the active alien civilizations that are capable of communication.
# Value explanations
### Stars in galaxy
Stellur density correlates to about 286,197,099,635 stars in the milky way.
### Fraction of stars with habitable planets
59% of stars have a planet between 0.85 and 4 times earth and habitable
### Fraction of planets that develop life
Assuming a planet remains habitable for so long, there is a long time for simple life forms to develop.
### Fraction of planets with life that develop intelligence
Of species including but not limited to (amphibians, reptiles, birds, etc), About 47% of these are considered intelligent.
### Fraction of planets that develop communication
About 2% of the intelligent species calculated to be primates. If intelligent enough, could communicate in space.
### Average lifespan of habitable planets
Earth's total habitable time is 7.79 billion years, we can assume this is the average.
### Time a civilization can communicate
If global warming wipes us out by 2150, that would mean we could communicate for 270 years, assuming alien civilizations aren't as populated as humans, we put this number to a more accurate number (2,700 years).
